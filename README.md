# Robot
This is a project of the Computer Graphics experiment.

I need to render a robot (or a human skeleton model), add the necessary animations (for example: walking), and of course, the most basic textures and lighting. The difficulty with this experiment is that the animation we design needs to be based on inverse kinematics.

My programming ability is not good, so I plan to use forward kinematics to implement a simple demo, so I use github for a version control. If I can do it in the future, I will modify it to be based on inverse kinematics.
